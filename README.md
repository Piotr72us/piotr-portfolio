# Responsive Portfolio

Second version of my Responsive Portfolio

This page uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:

* 97.8% HTML
* 2.2% CSS
* Some Bootstrap Magic (immesurable!)

My purpose was to create a mobile-friendly and responsive website that would be rendered properly on a variety of different screens, regardless of their sizes.

Navigation bar is collapsable on smaller screens.
Headers on each page are left-aligned and on smaller screens they are centered.

Main page and each sub-page utilize Bootstrap's features.
Portfolio page uses Bootstrap grid (columns and rows) to visualize my ficticious projects.

Pages have some margins on small and larger screens. However, pages do not have any margins on extra small screens - they fill the entire width of the page to better use limited screen size.

I found a way to create Sticky Footers although I didn't use Bootstrap tools to do so.

I validated HTML using the W3C Markup Validation Service: https://validator.w3.org/ .

There are fewer commits than I made in reality as I started this portfolio again from scratch after I had realized that my image links and assets folder were a bit messy.
